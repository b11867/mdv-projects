    <h2>Project 1</h2>

<article>
<p>I chose to develop an app rather than a story. I work for a printing company that uses various prinitng techniques, and I wanted to build a productivity application to help me sort through approved requests.</p>
<p>The general manager is responsible for approving which printing process is to be used for each printing request, so this program is meant to begin organizing that process.</p>
